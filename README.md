## Hi, I'm Pat. You've caught me in the middle of making a huge life transition.

My Github will show you the evolution of my work in the last year, starting with the Jupyter notebooks I used during my time as a trends and data reporter for a newspaper in South Dakota.

### What I know

More than any specific framework or language, I'm here for the journey:
- I'm really curious, so no matter how naive I maybe on a given topic I know I'll work my hardest to learn and understand the task in front of me
- Finding common bonds inspires me, I know I'll be happy if I'm bringing the world a little unity.
- Discomfort feels comfortable, I know I find the most value in solving problems.


### My current tech stack:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- React
- Node.js
- Express
- Postgresql
