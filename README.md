## Hi, I'm Pat, a software developer with 3+ years of professional experience and not a lot of time for Githubbing

My Github is mostly old schoolwork from the coding bootcamp I did in 2021, plus several curiosity-driven clones and forks. You won't see the bulk of my work here, but it does show you the evolution of my early training in Javascript and React.

### My current stack:
- C# | .NET
- T-SQL
- SSIS
- OracleDB
- MongoDB

### My old stack:
- React/Redux
- Javascript
- Node.js
- Express
- Postgresql
- HTML
- CSS
